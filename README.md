# CLI_rougelike

A very simple WIP CLI RPG. Download all files and compile Main.c
to play. Uses at least one Linux-specific library.

I'm sure the appearance of the game will differ depending on
your console/settings. In XFCE terminal, it looks like this:

If you're having issues with the display, please add/cut some
'\b' in the Main.c file shown below.
